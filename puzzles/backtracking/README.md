## Backtracking

**Backtracking** is a general algorithm for finding all (or some) solutions to 
some computational problems, notably constraint satisfaction problems, that 
incrementally builds candidates to the solutions, and abandons each 
partial candidate ("backtracks") as soon as it determines that the 
candidate cannot possibly be completed to a valid solution.
