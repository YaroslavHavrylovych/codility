next you must create a fast program for a small dataset, which can make a
backtracking with remembering solutions for subproblems.

i.e. for a give start point  - calculate the best solutions we could have.
than knapsack problem to find the max profit.

it's limited with 1000*1000 cells (but not limited with time), still it's 
better to estimate overall complexity to be sure I wouldn't wait for the
next century to finish the task.
