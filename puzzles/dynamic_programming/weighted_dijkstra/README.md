## Weighted Dijkstra 

[Original](https://www.topcoder.com/community/data-science/data-science-tutorials/dynamic-programming-from-novice-to-advanced/)

Preconditions:  Given an undirected graph G having positive weights
and N vertices.  You start with having a sum of M money.
For passing through a vertex i, you must pay S[i] money.
If you don’t have enough money – you can’t pass through that vertex.

TODO: Try to find the path to an end position (if multiple path exists - select
cheapest one).
