[Original](https://www.topcoder.com/community/data-science/data-science-tutorials/dynamic-programming-from-novice-to-advanced/)

Preconditions: 
Given a list of N coins, their values (V1, V2, … , VN), and the total sum S.

TODO:  Find the minimum number of coins the sum of which is S (we can use as
many coins of one type as we want), or report that it’s not possible to select
coins in such a way that they sum up to S.
