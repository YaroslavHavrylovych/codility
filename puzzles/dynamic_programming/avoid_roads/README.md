## Avoid roads

[Original](https://community.topcoder.com/stat?c=problem_statement&pm=1259&rd=4493)

Preconditions: 
In the city, roads are arranged in a grid pattern. Each point on the grid
represents a corner where two blocks meet. The points are connected by line
segments which represent the various street blocks. Using the cartesian
coordinate system, we can assign a pair of integers to each corner as shown
below. 

You are standing at the corner with coordinates 0,0. Your destination is at
corner width,height. 
In addition, the city has declared certain street blocks untraversable.
These blocks may not be a part of any path.

TODO: You will return the number of distinct paths that lead
to your destination. Each path must use exactly width+height blocks.
