## Dynamic programming

**Dynamic programming** (also known as dynamic optimization) is a method for 
solving a complex problem by breaking it down into a collection of simpler 
subproblems, solving each of those subproblems just once, and storing their 
solutions. The next time the same subproblem occurs, instead of recomputing 
its solution, one simply looks up the previously computed solution, 
thereby saving computation time at the expense of a (hopefully) 
modest expenditure in storage space.
