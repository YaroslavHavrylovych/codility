## Highway Billboard Problem

[Original](https://community.topcoder.com/stat?c=problem_statement&pm=1166&rd=4705)

Preconditions: 

You have been given a list of jewelry items that must be split amongst
two people: Frank and Bob. Frank likes very expensive jewelry.
Bob doesn't care how expensive the jewelry is, as long as he gets a lot of
jewelry. Based on these criteria you have devised the following policy:

1) Each piece of jewelry given to Frank must be valued greater than or equal
to each piece of jewelry given to Bob. In other words, Frank's least expensive
piece of jewelry must be valued greater than or equal to Bob's most expensive
piece of jewelry.

2) The total value of the jewelry given to Frank must exactly equal the total
value of the jewelry given to Bob.

3) There can be pieces of jewelry given to neither Bob nor Frank.

4) Frank and Bob must each get at least 1 piece of jewelry.

TODO: Determine the number of different ways
you can allocate the jewelry to Bob and Frank following the above policy.
