## Bolts and Nuts

Preconditions: Given N bolts of different sizes and corresponding N nuts (so
each bolt has a corresponding nut). You have a possibility to compare the bolt
with the nut and you can detect which is bigger or are they equal. But you
can't compare the bolt to another bolt and the nut to another nut.

TODO: pair each bolt with it's corresponding nut.
