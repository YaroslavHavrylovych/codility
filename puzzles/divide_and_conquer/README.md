## Divide and conquer

**Divide and conquer** is an algorithm design paradigm based on multi-branched 
recursion. A divide and conquer algorithm works by recursively breaking down 
a problem into two or more sub-problems of the same or related type, until 
these become simple enough to be solved directly. The solutions to the 
sub-problems are then combined to give a solution to the original problem.
