## Knight’s Tour Problem

[Original](http://algorithms.tutorialhorizon.com/backtracking-knights-tour-problem/)

Preconditions: A knight’s tour is a sequence of moves of a knight on 
a chess­board such that the knight visits every square only once. 
If the knight ends on a square that is one knight’s move from the beginning 
square (so that it could tour the board again immediately, 
following the same path), the tour is closed, other­wise it is open.

TODO: Make a tour (not closed, as closed takes too much time, I had never wait
until it's finished with backtracking approach).
