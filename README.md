# Coding Exercises

It's a playground of coding exercises, or just existing algorithms 
implementation (e.g. sorting). Solutions can be on
any language I want to try now. Each folder would have README file
with task description, or not if the folder is self describing 
(e.g. shell sort).

Solutions can be pretty old (thus not optimal) and one day, maybe, I would
review them, but not today.

## Attention

As solutions are custom some tasks are prohibited to use. Each task has
description which points to the place where I have seen it (origin).
Please check the origin to verify the possibility of usage for the task.
