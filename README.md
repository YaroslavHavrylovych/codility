# coding_exercises

It's a playground of coding exercises, or just existing algorithms 
implementation (e.g. sorting). Solutions can be on
any language I want to try now. Each forlder would have readme file
with task description, or not if the folder is self describing 
(e.g. shell sort).

Solutions can be pretty old (thus not optimal) and one day, maybe, I would
review them, but not today.
